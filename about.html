                <p>
                    Triangular Peg Solitaire is a strategy game where the player attempts 
                    to jump pegs over each other in order to end with just a single peg remaining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first known reference to this game was in 1687, since then it has become even 
                    more popular. This ever entertaining game is now at your fingertips!

                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <p>
                    The game starts with an empty hole at the top of the board. Jump pegs over each other
                    one at a time into an empty spot. The peg that was jumped over is then removed.
                    In order to win the game, one must end with one peg remaining. The
                    less number of moves used, the better.
