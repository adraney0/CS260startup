                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <p>
                    The game starts with an empty hole at the top of the board. Jump pegs over each other
                    one at a time into an empty spot. The peg that was jumped over is then removed.
                    In order to win the game, one must end with one peg remaining. The
                    less number of moves used, the better.
